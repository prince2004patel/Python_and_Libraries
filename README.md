#### Exercise - Data Analysis for Vacation Planning

You're planning a vacation, and you need to decide which city you want to visit. You have shortlisted four cities and identified the return flight cost, daily hotel cost, and weekly car rental cost. While renting a car, you need to pay for entire weeks, even if you return the car sooner.


| City | Return Flight (`$`) | Hotel per day (`$`) | Weekly Car Rental  (`$`) | 
|------|--------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Paris|       200                |       20         |          200           |
| London|      250                |       30         |          120           |
| Dubai|       370                |       15         |          80           |
| Mumbai|      450                |       10         |          70           |         


Answer the following questions using the data above:

1. If you're planning a 1-week long trip, which city should you visit to spend the least amount of money?
2. How does the answer to the previous question change if you change the trip's duration to four days, ten days or two weeks?
3. If your total budget for the trip is `$1000`, which city should you visit to maximize the duration of your trip? Which city should you visit if you want to minimize the duration?
4. How does the answer to the previous question change if your budget is `$600`, `$2000`, or `$1500`?

*Hint: To answer these questions, it will help to define a function `cost_of_trip` with relevant inputs like flight cost, hotel rate, car rental rate, and duration of the trip. You may find the `math.ceil` function useful for calculating the total cost of car rental.*

#### 🔍 Automating EMI Calculations with Python, NumPy, and CSV Files! 📊

I'm excited to share a recent project where I utilized Python and NumPy to automate the process of reading, processing, and writing CSV files for house loan information. 🏡

Project Highlights:
1. Reading Data: Using Python's csv module to read loan information from a CSV file.
2.Calculating EMI: Implementing the EMI calculation using the loan principal, interest rate, and loan tenure.
3.Storing Results: Writing the calculated EMI back to the CSV file, making the data ready for further analysis or reporting.

For those interested in the full code and a detailed explanation of the process, check out my GitHub repository. The repository includes:
-->A comprehensive guide on reading CSV files.
-->Detailed steps for calculating EMI.
-->Instructions for writing the results back to a CSV file.

What is a CSV File?
A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a simple text format for tabular data. Each line in the file corresponds to a row in the table, and each value is separated by a comma. It's widely used for data exchange because of its simplicity and compatibility with many software applications.

#### Over The Moon 

🚀 Just completed the "Explore Space with Python and Visual Studio Code" program by Microsoft, inspired by Netflix's "Over the Moon"! 🌙

This program provided hands-on experience with Apollo mission data (Apollo 11 to Apollo 17) on moon rocks. Using Python, I analyzed the types of lunar rocks and identified which ones are scarce on Earth. This data is crucial for NASA's upcoming Artemis mission, helping astronauts determine the types and quantities of moon rocks needed for future research.
