🔍 Automating EMI Calculations with Python, NumPy, and CSV Files! 📊

I'm excited to share a recent project where I utilized Python and NumPy to automate the process of reading, processing, and writing CSV files for house loan information. 🏡

Project Highlights:
1. Reading Data: Using Python's csv module to read loan information from a CSV file.
2.Calculating EMI: Implementing the EMI calculation using the loan principal, interest rate, and loan tenure.
3.Storing Results: Writing the calculated EMI back to the CSV file, making the data ready for further analysis or reporting.

For those interested in the full code and a detailed explanation of the process, check out my GitHub repository. The repository includes:

-->Detailed steps for calculating EMI.
-->Instructions for writing the results back to a CSV file.

What is a CSV File?
A CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file is a simple text format for tabular data. Each line in the file corresponds to a row in the table, and each value is separated by a comma. It's widely used for data exchange because of its simplicity and compatibility with many software applications.
